# FAO dashboard and maps

* In this project, I will build a special dashboard that will display visuals and choropleth maps about the distribution of crops all over different countries of the world.
* It is an interactive web app that is built using popular Python packages like Streamlit, Plotly, and Altair
* Datasets from the UN Humanitarian Data Centre will be used for the analysis and GeoJSON data from the GDAM websites will be used for the maps.
* The data will be updated from time to time
